### New scope

Decided to only narrow down to AI chatbot sites. Previous scope was too wide and consequentially too many problems.

*sigh* _Again..._

Session Switcher allows you to save, label, and swap between different accounts on AI chatbot sites with a single click - but with more QoL features.

### Old scope

Session Switcher allows you to save, label, and swap between different accounts on any website with a single click. Whether you are managing multiple ChatGPT accounts, switching between social media clients, or separating Work vs. Personal profiles, do it all without ever logging out.
