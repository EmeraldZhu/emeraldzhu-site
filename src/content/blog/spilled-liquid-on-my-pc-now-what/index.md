What was meant to be a fun night out (for the PC; in for us) almost went catastrophically wrong - well it kinda did, but quick thinking, prayers (lots) and research saved the day.

I kid you not when I say a lot of prayers, spraying, drying and patience went into this one.

### Context

You know one of those things that you keep telling yourself "I told you so"... well, I FAFO'd and damn did I find out hard. My PC (a picture will tell the story better... _soon_) is usually next to my desk on the ground (yeah, gotta work your vivid imagination muscles a bit). It's an ATX fish tank case with a very dare I say inviting top that's totally not covered - not in the least. Inviting why? Well, any accidental spills above the top of the case will go directly to my cooler (that's not a big problem, it's around ~$50) nd the part we care about the most (the GPU... >$800). But that's not all (at least it doesn't get worse, but it's still not good), nooo... right below the GPU is another uncovered base, below which the PSU (850W... >$100) lies. Thinking back, this PC case just invites trouble. But anyway, assuming your motherboard is safe from the spill (spoiler... it wasn't), you're looking at approximately ~$1000 (why did I just use approximate and `~` at the same time?) in damages. Now that you have some context, read on...
