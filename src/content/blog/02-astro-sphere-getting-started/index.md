I got tired of using VLC to watch my (legally obtained) shows and when I took a break and couldn't remember where I left off, had to rack my brains and waste precious time rewatching past episodes before remembering, damn, I had already watched this.

Then I started thinking to myself, "surely there's gotta be a better way to do this"...

And it doesn't have to look like it came from the '90s...

[Fine. I'll do it myself]

And so...

Using Jellyfin as my server, I transformed my local movies and shows (that I totally obtained legitimately) into a Netflix-like experience, complete with the Netflix features you've all come to love, minus the subscription. And yes, it's completely free. And you can even share your "Netflix" setup with others.

Might (will) make a video on YouTube too (shameless self-promo: [Emerald Zhu](https://www.youtube.com/@emeraldzhu))

### Features

- Video timeline scrubbing (I'll spare you the Google search - this is basically hovering over a video's progress bar and you can see a preview of a scene at a specific timestamp)
- Movie/Show theme songs
- Auto categorization
- Cast preview
- Auto subtitle downloads
- Beautiful UI
- Movie/Show backdrops
- Continue watching (which remembers where you left off)
